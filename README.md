# Delayed-Oil-Project
## PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Objective**
This project investigates the root causes of delays in the oil transfer process and proposes a strategic solution plan. Analyzing operational workflows, resource allocation, and process efficiency, it seeks to identify trends and key areas for improvement.

**Scope**

The analysis covers:
* Current transfer and handling protocols
* Staffing and equipment utilization patterns
* Service delay patterns and external influencing factors
* Operational bottlenecks and improvement opportunities

**Methodology**
- Data Collection: Gathering logs, staffing data, equipment status, and service records.
- Analysis: Identifying delay trends and correlating with operational factors.
- Root Cause Analysis: Diagnosing main delay contributors.
- Solution Proposal: Recommending solutions, such as process optimization and resource allocation.
